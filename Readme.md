# Simulating the WR28 Waveguide in Python

## About the project :
  The WR28 waveguide is a standard rectangular waveguide used in microwave and millimeter-wave applications. It operates in the frequency range of 26.5 to 40 GHz and is commonly used in radar, satellite communications, and other high-frequency systems.

  In this project, we will simulate the WR28 waveguide using Python. The simulation will involve calculating the electromagnetic field distribution, S-parameters, and other key characteristics of the waveguide. We will use libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for visualizing the results.
  
  Key Steps:
  Define Waveguide Dimensions: Specify the width and height of the WR28 waveguide.
  
  Set Material Properties: Define the conductivity of the waveguide walls and the relative permittivity of the dielectric material.
  
  Frequency Sweep: Perform a frequency sweep to analyze the waveguide's behavior over its operating range.
  
  Calculate S-Parameters: Compute the scattering parameters (S-parameters) to understand the waveguide's transmission and reflection characteristics.
  
  Visualize Results: Plot the electromagnetic field distribution and S-parameters using Matplotlib.
